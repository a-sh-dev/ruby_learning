# ♦️ RUBY LEARNING DOCUMENTATION

Learning lessons from various sources, such as:

- Coder Academy (bootcamp)
- Codecademy
- Code Wars
- HackerRank
- Various awesome free Youtube tutorials

##### Personal Note

The first OOP language learnt. It was very challenging at first to learn OOP language, but I think Ruby is beautifully written. It's neat, well organised, and very high-level language that is almost readable like normal English. There are a lot more to explore in Ruby! 

Ruby is defintely great to use as a foundation for Ruby on Rails in the web development platform.
